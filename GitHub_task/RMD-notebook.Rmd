## R Markdown

#This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, #PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see #<http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

#When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content #as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R #code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
